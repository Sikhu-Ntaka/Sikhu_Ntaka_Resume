            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </header>
    <p>I am am professional in the  Engineering sector, I graduaated with a Chemical Engineering degree  and worked in the power generation sector for the past 6 years. I have recently moved into the Tech industry through further studies in Software Engineering. I am particularly interested in how Tech can solve problems creatively. I would most like to get into data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and tech related to music.
    I love learning new skill as a new way to improve and re-invent myself as such I am always looking to find new hobbies.</p>
